## neural networks (seeds data)

seeds data set from UCI repository1

Explore the data.

Measurements of geometrical properties of kernels belonging to three different varieties of wheat. A soft X-ray technique and GRAINS package were used to construct all seven, real-valued attributes.

code
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
seeds <- read.table(
  "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00236/seeds_dataset.txt"
  )
colnames(seeds) <- c("area", 
                     "perimeter", 
                     "compactness", 
                     "length_of_kernel", 
                     "width_of_kernel",
                     "asy_coeff", 
                     "length_of_kernel_groove", 
                     "Class")
summary(seeds)
cor(dplyr::select(seeds, -Class))
```

```{r}
dim(seeds)
knitr::kable(head(seeds)) %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options="scale_down")
```
